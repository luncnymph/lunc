Dear #lunc Community:
	
As a community member and validator(lunc_nymph), I am trying to draft this roadmap for #lunc in 2023 and beyond. I welcome anyone to edit by making a pull request.
	
#lunc was born out of a disaster that everyone of us know back in May after TFL partially abandoned it. A group of volunteers called Terra Rebels came in to rescue it as the chain underwent some surgeries during the depeg including disabling IBC and marketSwap to stop minting and market arbitrage. Meanwhile the acceptance of new validators was closed to protect the existing ones who stayed to keep the chain alive given that the price of $lunc was falling to almost 0. 


# Repeg $USTC w/ timeline

**WHAT**: USTC can be pegged to $0.1 instead of $1 and all other local terra money to 0.1x their fiat value, which will get rid of 90% of the debt from the debacle.

**HOW:** We can re-enable the marketswap module and set the cap of lunc at 10b and ustc at 10b.

**WHEN:** when the price of luna hit $0.00014159. Planned date: before June 30, 2023


PS: we can expect to switch on the "repeg button" any time before the chain has restored its mint/burn function with the above price and cap settings.

**Scenarios**

S01: when the price of ustc on CEX is below 0.1, burn ustc until the balance of ustc hits 0 and wait. No minting of lunc.

S02: when the price of ustc on CEX is above, mint ustc into the market pool.

**Prerequist:** 
1. leverage commutity lunc and ustc to build the Market pool

2. The current burn tax policy doesn't change.

3. _Make the following equation true: FDV of lunc = FDV of ustc+ all other regional currencies._
